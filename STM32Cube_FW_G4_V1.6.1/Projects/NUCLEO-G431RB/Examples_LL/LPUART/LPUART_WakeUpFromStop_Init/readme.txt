@par Example Description
  
Configuration of GPIO and LPUART peripherals to allow characters 
received on LPUART_RX pin to wake up the MCU from low-power mode. This example is based 
on the LPUART LL API. The peripheral initialization uses LL 
initialization function to demonstrate LL init usage.

LPUART Peripheral is configured in asynchronous mode (9600 bauds, 8 data bit, 1 start bit, 1 stop bit, no parity).
No HW flow control is used.
LPUART Clock is based on HSI.

Example execution:
After startup from reset and system configuration, LED2 is blinking quickly during 3 sec,
then MCU  enters "Stop 0" mode (LED2 off).
On first  character reception by the LPUART from PC Com port (ex: using HyperTerminal)
after "Stop 0" Mode period, MCU wakes up from "Stop 0" Mode.

Received character value is checked :
- On a specific value ('S' or 's'), LED2 is turned On and program ends.
- If different from 'S' or 's', program performs a quick LED2 blinks during 3 sec and 
  enters again "Stop 0" mode, waiting for next character to wake up.

In case of errors, LED2 is slowly blinking (1 sec period).

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32G431RBTx devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-G431RB RevC board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-G431RB RevC Set-up
    - Connect STM32 MCU board LPUART1 TX pin (GPIO PC1 connected to pin 36 of CN7 connector)
      to PC COM port RX signal
    - Connect STM32 MCU board LPUART1 RX pin (GPIO PC0 connected to pin 38 of CN7 connector)
      to PC COM port TX signal
    - Connect STM32 MCU board GND to PC COM port GND signal

    - Launch serial communication SW on PC (as HyperTerminal or TeraTerm) with proper configuration 
      (9600 bauds, 8 bits data, 1 stop bit, no parity, no HW flow control). 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
