@par Example Description

How to enter the Stop 1 mode.

After start-up LED2 is toggling during 5 seconds, then the system automatically 
enter in Stop 1 mode (Final state).

LED2 is used to monitor the system state as follows:
 - LED2 toggling : system in Run mode
 - LED2 off : system in Stop 1 mode

This example does not implement a wake-up source from any peripheral: to wake-up the device,
press on Reset button.

@note To measure MCU current consumption on board STM32G4,
      board configuration must be applied:
      - remove jumper JP6 and connect an amperemeter to measure current between the 2 connectors of JP6.

@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact 
      that the Cortex-M4 core is no longer clocked during low power mode 
      so debugging features are disabled.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32G491RETx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-G491RE RevA
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - NUCLEO-G491RE RevA Set-up
    - LED2 connected to PA.05 pin

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
